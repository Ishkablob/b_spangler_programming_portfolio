This is the final project for my game engine development class.  During the course of the class, each student developed
their own game engine that through Microsoft XNA, and this game engine was used for the different assignments and
activities in the class.  It was also used for this final project, which is a keyboard take on the traditional Guitar
Hero style rhythm game.  The player uses the keyboard to play notes to a song, represented by black cubes, and there
are two different songs to play.

This is one of my older projects - created in fall 2018 - but it is still one of my favorite programming projects that
I worked on throughout college.  The game engine used is a culmination of all the work done through the semester, and the
game itself utilizes the game engine's ability to draw objects on the screen, play music, read key commands, and more.
