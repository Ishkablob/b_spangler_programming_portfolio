This is a repository containing a collection of university projects I have worked on throughout my college career.
A lot of my school projects were made and completed using local storage, and this is my attempt to compile some
of my favorites into a location for employers to be able to access and browse.

In the future, I will be using this repository to work on any other personal projects I find time for.  During my
college career, I would often start personal projects on local storage, but they would always be interrupted due to
university class projects taking precedence, and once they went on hold, I rarely came back to them.  Now that I have
graduated, I will be trying to find more time to work on personal projects to sharpen my skills, and I will be trying
to keep this repository updated with them all.
