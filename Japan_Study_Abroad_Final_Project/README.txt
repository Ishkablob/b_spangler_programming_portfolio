This folder contains all the files for my final project in my ASU Study Abroad
entitled Visualization and Simulation of Japan.  This study abroad took place over
the course of 2 weeks during May 2019, and during this time, ~18 other students,
the study abroad director and myself lived in, took classes in, and explored Tokyo.
The course taught simulation techniques in Unity, including techniques for simulating
trains, crosswalks, pedestrian movement, and cars using built-in Unity functionality.
During the second week, all students were required to find some sort of area within
Tokyo that they could apply at least two of the simulation techniques to create a
Unity simulation of that area.

For my project, I ended up simulating the train and pedestrian system for movement
throughout the Disney Tokyo Resort.  I visited this area for a day during my time there,
and through this exploration I was able to create a rudimentary model of the area in Unity,
including areas designated for different parks, different hotels and shopping areas,
and the two train lines that run through this area.  I only was given a week to complete
this project, along with other daily assignments the study abroad class assigned, so
the modeling and accuracy of the model is extremely rough.  I also wrote scripts that
move people between trains and into parks or hotels to simulate people moving throughout
the park, and the user can use sliders and toggles to alter the "rush hour factor", or the
amount of people entering the simulation, as well as simulation run speed.

This project was then presented during the class, and I created a tutorial image to show
the user's perspective and controls of the simulation.  These files are provided in the folder.
I attempted to fit the entire Unity project into the folder, but due to its size, Github
could not accept this.  So, I have provided some of the script files used in the demo
in a separate folder called "Script Files".  These are just stand-alone .cs files used
in scripting the simulation; if I find a better way to upload this in the future that
allows for larger file sizes, I will make sure to include the entire Unity project folder
for this project as well.
