This project was an additional honors college project for CSE446 Software Integration
and Engineering.  The project builds off a previous project in CSE445 Distributed Software
Deployment, where we were assigned, in groups of three, to create SOAP or REST API services
in C# that would eventually be combined into an application that used them all.  These APIs,
as well as the TryIt demo pages, were to be reprogrammed in Python as services and deployed
to a remote service, such as AWS or Azure.

This folder contains the VisualStudio folder used to create the Python project files, both
for the services and TryIt pages.  These were then uploaded to the Heroku free tier of remote
storage, and they can be accessed at the following website: 

https://cse-446-honors-contract-bspang.herokuapp.com/

All three services can be tested by going to the correct sub-URL described on the main
page.

This project was my first real attempt at using Python for more than just simple scripting
purposes, as well as using Python API packages such as Flask.  This is also the first
project I uploaded to a remote server for anyone to access at any time.  It is pretty simple
in terms of programming, but it helps to show my work on API packages and use of cloud systems.
It is also one of the projects I learned the most from during my time in college, mostly due
to the reasons mentioned above.
