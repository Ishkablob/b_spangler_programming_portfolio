Honors Contract Final Submission:

This is the final submission.  The Flask file was cleaned up significantly to remove excess
details.  It works correctly on the localhost server.

The files were then uploaded to the Heroku free tier server.  It can be found at this link:
https://cse-446-honors-contract-bspang.herokuapp.com/

All three TryIt pages are located here.


Honors Contract Midterm Turnin:

I have spent a good amount of time trying to understand Flask and Python APIs throughout break.
I got some information on it, such as setting up the function to have an endpoint.
However, I haven't yet tested if any of the Python code works or if the APIs work, or
if there is anything else I need to do with Flask to make the APIs function correctly.  I will
likely be reaching out to either Dr. Chen or a TA over the next week or so to discuss some
of the problems I was facing.

Since this is a midterm progress turnin, I don't think those are a huge issue.  I have the
services document made during assignments 5 and 6 included in the turnin to describe the
function of the services.  It is the same document I turned in for my CSE445 assignment, just
with the other team member's parts taken out.

Research:
Research done for Flask includes the following websites:

https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask#implementing-our-api
https://kite.com/blog/python/flask-restful-api-tutorial/

Timetable:
Final submission is April 22nd.
End of March: set up and test APIs to confirm they are working properly
First week of April: integrate Python APIs with TryIt pages (already done in CSE445)
Second week of April: research and learn AWS, upload services and TryIt pages to AWS
This gives about half a week of reprive, in case anything goes wrong and requires more time.
